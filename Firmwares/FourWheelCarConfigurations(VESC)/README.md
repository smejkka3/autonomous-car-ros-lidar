# VESC Tool Configurations

As an ESC(Electronic Speed Controller) we are using the open source ESC called VESC(Vedder ESC) on the 4WD platform.

VESC has a GUI Called VESC Tool (https://vesc-project.com/vesc_tool) which allowed  us to rapidly tune our motor driving experience.

For Initial usage you can use our motor driving parameters and app parameters.

To do so open VESC Tool application and :



File->Load Parameters -> Load Motor Parameters and choose `MotorFinal.xml` and also ;

File->Load Parameters -> Load App Parameters and choose `AppFinal.xml`.



After following these steps you will be able to use VESC Tool properly for our motor.

The motor low-level control parameters and their descriptions are documented under:
