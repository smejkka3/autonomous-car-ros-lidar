# jetsonTX2Power

Reads the hardware sensors on the [Jetson TX2](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/buy/jetson-tx2) [embedded kit](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems-dev-kits-modules/) board and either prints the values on the screen os writes a CSV file.

A very useful resource is the [Jetson TX2 - INA226 (Power Monitor with i2C Interface)](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1000830/?offset=12#5252962) forum thread on the NVIDIA Developers forum. [This one](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1032940/jetson-tx2/soc-voltage/post/5255540/#5255540) also has some useful information

## Power Rails on the TX2

The power rails on the TX2 module and the carrier board are monitored by four [INA3221](http://www.ti.com/product/INA3221) devices. These monitors can read up to three rails (both voltage and current) each. 
The monitors are exposed by SYSFS, device is ``in_voltageN_input`` [0..2] and the corresponding current device is ``in_currentN_input`` [0..2].

The TX2 has two INA3221 power monitors:
```bash
/sys/devices/3160000.i2c/i2c-0/0-0040/iio_device
/sys/devices/3160000.i2c/i2c-0/0-0041/iio_device
```

While the carrier board has other two INA3221:

```bash
/sys/devices/3160000.i2c/i2c-0/0-0042/iio_device
/sys/devices/3160000.i2c/i2c-0/0-0043/iio_device
```

The power rails are (gathered from the NVIDIA Jetson TX2/TX2i OEM PRODUCT DESIGN GUIDE and the Jetson TX1-TX2 Developer Kit Carrier Board Design Files schematic):

## Usage

There's a Python module and C++ and C code. All can be used independently.

### Python

First you need to get a list of the hardware sensors, use the `create_devices()` function, like so:

```python
import jetsonTX2Power as tx2pwr

pwr_devices=tx2pwr.create_devices()
```

The `pwr_devices` variable will be used to all other functions. The `create_devices()` function opens the I2C sys devices in Linux and reads the rail names. The list of devices returned by `create_devices()` doesn't have any state or open file descriptor, so there's no `destroy` function or method.

To write to a CSV file, use the function `to_csv`:

```python
def to_csv(csv_file, devices, comment='', xtra_fields=None):
```

The arguments are:

1. csv_file: a string with the file named to be used. If the file doesn't exists it will be created and the header will be written. If it exists the new values will be appended.

2. devices: The return value from the `create_devices` function.

3. comment: a simple comment that will be placed on the _comment_ column.

4. xtra_fields: dictionary with custom fields:value pairs. If it is passed as an argument, the _comment_ field will not be written, the curstom fields will be passed directly to the dictionary used by the [`csv.DictWriter`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html) function.

### C++

Pretty similitar to the Python script.

I promise to write a better help soon!

### C

Soon!
